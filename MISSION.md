# MISSION.md — Kamunity AI  Readiness

## Strategic Outcome

**A free AI readiness self-assessment for community organisations. Users answer 12 questions in about 2 minutes and get a personalised readiness map across four dimensions (Understanding, Current Use, Safety & Ethics, Readiness to Act) with specific recommendations. The site also hosts a free toolkit of guides, prompt kits, and checklists, plus a pathway to paid consulting services with transparent pricing.**

## Why This Matters

Community orgs are adopting AI tools without understanding the implications — staff are putting client data into ChatGPT, boards are asking "what's our AI strategy?" and getting blank stares, and vendors are pushing products that create lock-in. There's no simple, free, sovereignty-aware starting point for the community sector.

## What "Done" Looks Like (North Star)

A person who needs this tool can:
1. **Find** it when searching for a solution to their problem
2. **Understand** what it does in under 30 seconds
3. **Use** it to solve their actual problem
4. **Trust** it enough to rely on it

This is a north star, not a Phase 1 target.

## Who This Is For

**Primary:** Priya — Operations coordinator at a 12-person NFP in Fremantle. She's the unofficial tech person because she's the most comfortable with computers. She's heard about AI at conferences but hasn't done anything with it yet. Her CEO just asked "should we be using AI?" and she doesn't know how to answer. She's on her laptop between meetings, has maybe 15 minutes right now.

**Secondary:** Board members wanting to understand AI risk for governance. CEOs of small orgs who need to make technology decisions. Volunteer coordinators who've noticed volunteers using ChatGPT and don't know if that's OK. Grant managers wondering if AI can help with reporting. WACOSS digital inclusion workers looking for training resources to recommend.

**Not for:** Define this during Phase 1 research — who is explicitly outside your scope?

## What This Is NOT

Not an AI chatbot itself. Not a tool that writes grants or reports (that's what the prompt kit helps you do elsewhere). Not a cybersecurity assessment. Not an IT procurement system. Not a Microsoft/Google/vendor-specific training platform.

It IS the bridge between "community orgs are adopting ai tools without understanding the implications — staff are putting client data into chatgpt, boards are asking "what's our ai strategy?" and getting blank stares, and vendors are pushing products that create lock-in" and "I have a working tool that helps."
