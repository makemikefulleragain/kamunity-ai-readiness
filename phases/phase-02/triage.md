# Phase 2 Triage — The Toolkit

## Highest-Value Build

**Build 6 toolkit resource pages as web content with a toolkit hub, linked from quiz recommendations.** The Prompt Kit is the crown jewel.

## Triage Decision: Build From Scratch

### What exists we could link to?
- Charity Excellence prompt library — UK-focused, requires registration. Link as "further reading" but don't depend on it.
- OAIC privacy guidance — link as authoritative reference in Safety Checklist.
- Australia's Voluntary AI Safety Standard — link as reference, not as primary content.
- Anthropic AI Fluency course — link as "want to go deeper?" resource.

### Scope Adjustment
- **PDF downloads deferred to Phase 3+** — web pages are more valuable right now (linkable, accessible, no download friction)
- **Copy-to-clipboard on prompts** — higher value than PDF for the prompt kit
- **20 prompts reduced to quality over quantity** — better to have 20 excellent, tested prompts than 30 mediocre ones

### Build Priority (within Phase 2)
1. Toolkit hub page (`/toolkit`)
2. AI Prompt Kit (`/toolkit/prompt-kit`) — crown jewel
3. Safety Checklist (`/toolkit/safety-checklist`) — highest-urgency for orgs handling sensitive data
4. Plain English AI Guide (`/toolkit/ai-guide`)
5. First Steps Guide (`/toolkit/first-steps`)
6. Ethics Checklist (`/toolkit/ethics-checklist`)
7. Board Briefing (`/toolkit/board-briefing`)

### Quiz Integration
- Update quiz recommendations to link directly to relevant toolkit pages
- Each toolkit page links back to the quiz

## Phase Goal: CONFIRMED — proceed to spec.
