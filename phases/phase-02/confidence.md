# Phase 2 Confidence Score — The Toolkit

## Dimensions (25 points each, 100 total)

### Research Signal: 22/25
- Clear gap confirmed: no community-sector AI toolkit exists in Australia
- Reviewed Charity Excellence (UK), NTEN (US), Anthropic courses, OAIC guidance, Australian Gov standards
- Prompt categories derived from actual community org work patterns
- Minor deduction: no direct user testing of prompt quality yet

### Source Convergence: 21/25
- Multiple sources agree on need for safety-first approach
- Australian Government standards align with our safety/ethics content
- Prompt structure informed by Charity Excellence's tested approach (adapted for AU community sector)
- Minor deduction: community sector-specific evidence remains thin; most prompt resources target US/UK charity fundraising

### Constitutional Alignment: 25/25
- All 7 inviolable principles verified in critique
- Sovereignty: zero data collection, clipboard-only interaction
- Harm check: safety resources are prominent, Indigenous Data Sovereignty named, vulnerable populations flagged
- Progressive enhancement: Phase 1 preserved perfectly
- Every resource serves Priya's actual needs

### Build Confidence: 23/25
- Build succeeds on first attempt
- All routes and interactions verified
- Copy-to-clipboard works with fallback for older browsers
- Quiz-to-toolkit links render correctly
- Minor deduction: bundle size grew to 614KB (was 553KB) — still acceptable but worth monitoring
- Minor deduction: no automated tests
