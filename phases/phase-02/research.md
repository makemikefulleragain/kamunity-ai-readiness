## Key Findings

### Existing Prompt Resources — Useful But Not Fit For Purpose

| Resource | Target | Prompts | Fit for Priya? |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Charity Excellence (UK) | UK charities | 60+ | Partially — UK-focused, requires registration, not community-sector specific |
| Qgiv prompts | US nonprofits | ~10 | No — fundraising-focused |
| Nonprofit News Feed | US nonprofits | 29 | Partially — good ideas but tech-heavy language |
| Funraise | US nonprofits | 6 | No — marketing-focused |
| NTEN Resource Hub | US nonprofits | Curated links | Good reference but not copy-paste prompts |
| Anthropic AI Fluency | Nonprofits | Course format | Good concept but not a quick reference |

**Gap:** No copy-paste prompt kit exists for Australian community orgs. Existing resources assume fundraising context (US/UK charity sector), not service delivery context (Australian community sector — neighbourhood centres, family services, disability, homelessness).

### Safety & Ethics Resources

- **Australia's Voluntary AI Safety Standard** (Aug 2024) — 10 guardrails, references Indigenous Data Sovereignty. Enterprise-focused but principles are transferable.
- **OAIC Privacy Guidance on AI** — practical, Australian, covers sensitive information risks. Good source for safety checklist content.
- **NTEN AI Policy Template** — US-focused but good structure for policy creation.
- Key principle from Charity Excellence: "We strongly recommend that you do not include any sensitive personal or financial information in your prompt."

### Board/Governance Resources

- BoardPro AI Policy Template — comprehensive but enterprise-level complexity
- BoardEffect article on AI governance for nonprofits — good framing
- No simple, one-page "here's what your board needs to know about AI" exists for small orgs

### What Priya Actually Needs (Synthesis)

1. **Prompt Kit:** 20 prompts she can copy-paste TODAY for real community org tasks (meeting notes, grant reporting, policy drafting, volunteer comms — NOT fundraising)
2. **Plain English Guide:** "What is AI?" in 5 minutes, no jargon, Australian context
3. **First Steps Guide:** "Your team wants to try AI — here's how to start safely"
4. **Safety Checklist:** One-page printable — "Before you use any AI tool, check these 8 things"
5. **Ethics Checklist:** "Is this AI use appropriate for our community?" decision framework
6. **Board Briefing:** One-pager a CEO can hand to their board chair

### Technical Decision: Web Pages vs PDFs

- **Web pages first** — accessible, linkable from quiz recommendations, searchable
- **PDF export is Phase 3+ scope** — adds complexity, not the highest-value thing right now
- Each resource should be a single, scrollable page with clear sections
- "Copy to clipboard" buttons on prompts are higher value than PDF download

## Research Signal: STRONG

Clear gap in community-sector-specific resources. Quiz recommendations already reference these resources by name. Building them completes the value loop from assessment → action.
