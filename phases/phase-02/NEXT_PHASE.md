### The Services (Make it sustainable)
Per PHASE_QUEUE.md, Phase 3 covers:
- Workshop, strategy session, and full mapping service pages with transparent pricing
- Process descriptions and booking/contact flow
- Testimonials section (empty initially, ready to populate)
- Case studies section
- Make it findable by humans and AI (SEO, meta tags, structured data)
- Make it secure (review for vulnerabilities)
- Contact flow: ask for consent before opening email, use mike@kamunityconsulting.com
- Netlify forms (3 emoji + optional text feedback)

### Recommended Phase 3 Scope
1. **Services pages** — 3 tiers: Workshop ($X), Strategy Session ($X), Full AI Readiness Mapping ($X)
2. **Contact flow** — consent-first email approach, Netlify forms for feedback
3. **SEO & discoverability** — meta tags, Open Graph, structured data, sitemap
4. **Testimonials/case studies** — empty sections with structure ready to populate
5. **Security review** — input validation, dependency audit, CSP headers

### Open Questions for Phase 3 Research
- What are appropriate price points for community sector consulting?
- What contact flow respects user consent while being practical?
- What SEO signals matter most for community org discovery?
- Should there be a separate /contact page or inline forms?
