# Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff

## What Phase 1 Delivered
- Working landing page with clear value proposition
- 12-question AI readiness quiz across 4 dimensions
- Radar chart results with personalised recommendations
- Sensitive data warnings and funder notes
- Fully client-side, no data collection
- Builds and deploys to Netlify

## What Phase 2 Should Address

### The Toolkit (Make it useful)
The quiz recommendations currently reference resources that don't exist yet:
- "Kamunity AI Prompt Kit — 20 practical prompts"
- "Plain English AI Guide"
- "First Steps guide"
- "10-minute Safety Checklist"
- "Ethics Checklist"

These need to become real, downloadable resources hosted on the site.

### Recommended Phase 2 Scope
1. **Toolkit landing page** at `/toolkit` — hub for all free resources
2. **6 resource pages** (or as many as research validates):
   - AI Prompt Kit (the crown jewel — 20 practical prompts for community workers)
   - Plain English AI Guide
   - First Steps Guide
   - Safety Checklist
   - Ethics Checklist
   - Board Briefing Template
3. **Quiz-to-toolkit links** — recommendations link directly to relevant resources
4. **PDF downloads** for each resource
5. **Navigation update** — add Toolkit to site nav

### Open Questions for Phase 2 Research
- What prompts do community workers actually need? (research required)
- Should resources be single-page or multi-page?
- Is PDF generation needed, or are hosted web pages sufficient?
- Are there existing open resources we should link to rather than recreate?

## Human Action Needed Before Phase 2
See `HUMAN_ACTION.md` for deployment steps.
