# Human Action Required — Phase 1

## Deploy to Netlify

The site is built and ready to deploy. The `dist/` folder contains everything needed.

### Option A: Deploy via Windsurf (Recommended)
If you'd like me to deploy for you, just say "deploy" and I'll use the deploy tool to push to Netlify.

### Option B: Manual Deploy
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Create a new site (or connect to existing repo)
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy

### Recommended Subdomain
`kamunity-ai-readiness` → `kamunity-ai-readiness.netlify.app`

## Review the Quiz
Before deploying publicly, you may want to:
1. Read through all 12 questions — do they feel right for your audience?
2. Check the recommendations — are they what you'd advise?
3. Verify the sensitive data warning text
4. Confirm the footer links (kamunity.org, kamunity-audit.netlify.app)

## What's Blocked Until Deploy
- No public URL to share
- Can't test on real mobile devices (unless using local network)
- Phase 2 toolkit resources won't be linkable from quiz recommendations until site is live
