# Phase 1 Triage — The Quiz

## Highest-Value Build

**Build the 12-question AI readiness quiz with radar chart results and personalised recommendations.** Nothing existing serves this audience. This is greenfield and high-impact.

## Triage Decision: Build From Scratch

### What exists we could integrate with?
- **Nothing suitable.** All existing AI readiness tools target enterprise/business audiences with enterprise language and enterprise assumptions.
- ARM Hub's tool requires contact details before showing results — violates sovereignty.
- SurveyMonkey templates require accounts and don't produce radar charts.
- No open-source community-sector AI readiness quiz exists.

### Is the phase goal still right?
**Yes.** Research confirms the gap. The 4 dimensions (Understanding, Current Use, Safety & Ethics, Readiness to Act) are well-differentiated from enterprise frameworks and map to where community orgs actually are in their AI journey.

### Highest-value decisions:

1. **4-point scale (not 5)** — avoids the neutral middle that plagues self-assessments. Forces meaningful signal.
2. **One question per screen on mobile** — reduces cognitive load, gives progress feedback.
3. **Warm, plain-English language** — no jargon. Questions should feel like a conversation with a trusted colleague.
4. **Results = radar chart + dimension summaries + 3 specific next steps** — immediately actionable.
5. **Screenshot-friendly results page** — Priya needs to show her CEO.
6. **No data collection** — results computed entirely client-side, nothing stored or transmitted.
7. **Scaffold full site structure** — landing page + quiz + results, ready for Phase 2 toolkit pages.

## Phase Goal: CONFIRMED — proceed to spec.
