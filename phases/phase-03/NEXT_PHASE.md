# Phase 3 → Phase 4 Handoff

## What Phase 3 Delivered
- Services page with 3 tiers and transparent pricing
- Consent-first contact button (mailto: with modal)
- Anonymous emoji feedback widget (Netlify Forms)
- SEO foundations (OG tags, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots.txt, page titles)
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Navigation updated (Home, Toolkit, Services, Take the Quiz)
- Deployed to production

## What Phase 4 Should Address

Per PHASE_QUEUE: "Whatever research and user feedback from earlier phases reveals as the next priority."

### Suggested Phase 4 Priorities (to be validated by research)

1. **localStorage persistence** — Save quiz answers so results survive page refresh
2. **Code splitting** — Bundle is 625KB, should be split to improve load time
3. **PDF export** — Let users download toolkit resources as PDFs
4. **Accessibility audit** — Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance review
5. **Analytics-free metrics** — Understand usage without tracking (e.g. Netlify Analytics, privacy-respecting)
6. **Content refinement** — Based on feedback widget data
7. **Testimonials** — Populate once real clients provide feedback
8. **Cross-links with kamunity-audit** — Deeper integration between companion sites

### Open Questions
- What does feedback widget data tell us?
- Are real users finding and completing the quiz?
- Which toolkit resources are most accessed?
- Is the contact flow generating enquiries?
