# PHASE_QUEUE.md — Kamunity AI  Readiness
# This queue is a hypothesis. You can and should modify it based on research.

---

## How This Works

Each phase is a broad goal, not a feature spec. You research what's needed, build the highest-value implementation, and propose the next phase based on what you learned.

**You may:**
- Reorder phases if research reveals different priorities
- Replace a phase with something research shows is more valuable
- Split a phase if it's too big
- Add phases you discover are needed

**You must:**
- Document every change with reasoning
- Never skip the research step
- Leave the site in a deployable state after every phase

## The Queue

### Phase 1: The Quiz (Make it real):** The 12-question AI readiness self-assessment with radar chart results and personalised recommendations
**Goal:** The Quiz (Make it real):** The 12-question AI readiness self-assessment with radar chart results and personalised recommendations. Entirely client-side. Beautiful, warm, accessible. Mobile-first. Takes 2 minutes. Produces a result that's immediately useful and shareable (screenshot-friendly).
**Why first:** This is the most important thing to get right before anything else.

### Phase 2: The Toolkit (Make it useful):** Host the six free guides/resources
**Goal:** The Toolkit (Make it useful):** Host the six free guides/resources. Each linked from relevant quiz recommendations. Downloadable as PDFs. The prompt kit is the crown jewel — 20 tested, practical prompts that community workers can copy-paste and use today.
**Why second:** Build on Phase 1's foundation with the next most valuable feature.

### Phase 3: The Services (Make it sustainable):** Workshop, strategy session, and full mapping service pages with transparent pricing, process descriptions, and booking/contact flow
**Goal:** The Services (Make it sustainable):** Workshop, strategy session, and full mapping service pages with transparent pricing, process descriptions, and booking/contact flow. Testimonials section (empty initially, ready to populate). Case studies section.

**Why third:** After the core is working, add depth and polish.

### Phase 4+: Expand Based on Evidence
**Goal:** Whatever research and user feedback from earlier phases reveals as the next priority.
**Why last:** By this point, real users should be using the tool and providing feedback. Build what they actually need.
