# AI READINESS ROADMAP
## User-Informed Development Queue
### Last Updated: Feb 20, 2026

## Current State
- 12-question AI readiness quiz + results toolkit
- React + Tailwind + Vite — deployed to kamunity-ai-readiness.netlify.app via GitHub CI/CD
- Honest disclaimer added Feb 19 (KP-01 ✅)
- No user data collected — fully client-side
- Key metrics: none yet (no analytics — by design)
- Known issues: Kai doesn't run quiz inline conversationally (t26 open)

## User Feedback Log
| Date | Source | Feedback | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| (entries from actual user encounters) | | | |

## Improvement Queue

### Now (This Sprint)
- [ ] Kai runs quiz inline conversationally — questions as encounter cards, results interpreted by Kai (t26)
- [ ] Kai describes AI Readiness tool to visitors who mention it (t28)
- [ ] Cross-link to kamunity.org and sibling sites (t15)
- [ ] Add llms.txt for ecosystem discoverability (t15)

### Next (Next Sprint)
- [ ] ElevenLabs reads results aloud — accessibility-first (Opus Move 7)
- [ ] ALIKE disability sector framing — results language reviewed for disability orgs
- [ ] Results shareable as PDF or link (board presentation use case)

### Later
- [ ] Pattern Dashboard integration — aggregate anonymous results (Phase 3, 20+ org threshold)
- [ ] Sector-specific variants (disability, mental health, housing)
- [ ] "What to do next" referral to Perth Directory (Phase 2)

## Research Needed
- What does ALIKE CEO expect from an AI readiness tool? (gap g10 — knowledge level unknown)
- Do results resonate with disability sector workers specifically?
- Should quiz be embeddable in other sites (iframe or API)?
